### Hi there 👋

Hi, piacere Giuseppe. I am a **neapolitan** cloud engineer. With a degree in computer science and specializing in **cloud computing**.

I have studied and work on everything related to the cloud. From the first approach to the first steps in cloud. I have experience with small and large migrations for small and large clients. I have also built entire systems with cloud native methodology.

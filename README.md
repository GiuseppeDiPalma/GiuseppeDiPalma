### Hi there 👋
Hi, everybody. I'm Giuseppe , a 26 year old Neapolitan with a passion for computers. This is my personal space.
I am currently completing my master's degree in cloud computing at the University of Salerno.
In my free time I practice juggling and I edit two independent music webzines.
Everything you need to know about me will be available on these pages. 
😁
